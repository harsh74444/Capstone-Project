    "    Selecting the right area to open a new restaurant is very important for its viability. Opening a restaurant in a not so favourable area not only affects its viability but also costs financially to the owner. In a metropolitan city like Mumbai, location is of utmost importance when it comes to restaurants. People in Mumbai prefers to live with people nearby of same ethnicity and hence prefers to visit restaurants serving such type of food."
